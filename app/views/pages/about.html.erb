<h1>About</h1>

<p>
The minimal tag length is two letters, please do not use shorter words
to search the corpus.  The search word becomes the first tag for all
the parts from the uploaded source.  All the tags are unique, new tag
is not created if the same word exists in the database.  In the case
of complicated search queries, the first word of the query is taken as
the first tag.  Therefore it is reasonable to put a full form of the
search term at the beginning of the query, although it is not required
since the tag can be renamed. There is a possible pitfall: tags are
not checked for similarity, therefore tag <i>reden</i> is allowed even
if word <i>rede</i> is already in the database.  The tags are sorted
alphabetically, it should be easy to track such kind of similarity.
</p>

<p>
When a source is destroyed, all the parts from that source are deleted
as well.  On the other hand, the tags are kept even when all the
related parts and sources are destroyed.  If tag is destroyed it is
also removed from all the parts, parts are allowed not to have any
tags.  For removal all the tags from the part, make sure that none are
selected in the list during part editing (CTRL-click can be used to
select or deselect an item).
</p>

<p>
A note can be attached to the parts, for example it can explain why
tags were assigned to the part.  When a part is created, the note
field has value <em>nil</em>, this not the same as empty string.  If
the part is saved after edition, <em>nil</em> become a string.
</p>

<p>
The parts listing is sorted by the time they were updated, the most
recent update goes to the end of the list.  This way all the
non-edited parts are on top.  Setting or removing tags does not update
the part on its own, only changes in note or content field matters.
