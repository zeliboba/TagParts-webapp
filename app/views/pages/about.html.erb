<h1>About</h1>

<p>
The minimal tag length is two letters, please do not use shorter words
to search the corpus.  The search word becomes the first tag for all
the parts from the uploaded source.  All the tags are unique, new tag
is not created if the same word exists in the databese.  In the case
of complicated search queries, the first word of the query is taken as
the first tag.  Therefore it is reasonable to put a full form of the
search term at the beginning of the query, although it is not required
since the tag can be renamed. There is a possible pitfall: tags are
not checked for similarity, therefore tag <i>reden</i> is allowed even
if word <i>rede</i> is already in the database.
